Balvi is a direct gifting fund for deploying quickly to high-value Covid projects that traditional institutional or commercial funding sources tend to overlook for being too early or “outside the box”, or because there’s no financial incentive. The default preference is for projects in LIC/LMIC countries, in order to help address global inequity by working "from the bottom up", but any project with potential to create global benefit is in-scope regardless of location. Our experience is that open source or public domain projects have the greatest potential to make a positive impact, so we favour those most strongly. We do not cover indirect costs.
